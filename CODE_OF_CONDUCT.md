# This is the Ferus code of conduct. 
It has nothing unique to it. Just the basic blabber.

# Don't make racist, sexist, misogynistic or androgynistic remarks towards anyone.
Ferus hardly has anything to call a "community" yet but still, even with the 2 or 3 people that track the progress, please don't fight like this.

# No politics are allowed.
Ferus is intended to display webpages, execute JavaScript and other stuff web browsers do. That's it. \
It is NOT supposed to tell you about how right wingers are the epitome of evil or how left wingers make a country weak. \
No discourse may be based on regional, or global politics. And ABSOLUTELY NO commits or changes must be made in relation to any events.

# Be respectful
Respect others boundaries, and when you feel they are uncomfortable continuining the conversation, look back at if you did anything
remotely wrong. Passive aggressiveness is as bad as outright aggression.

Sexual jokes must not be made, and any demeaning jokes making fun of a contributor/interested person will not be tolerated.

We do not care if you are Chinese, Indian, American, Russian, Finnish, British, or Japanese. We just care that you are a respectful person.

# Think twice before using certain words
Slurs are outlawed. 
Don't add words like "retarded" or "dumbass" in your commit messages. We get it, Ferus' some parts are really badly made, 
but that does not justify such words.

# When a disagreement is created, do not go senile.
All projects encounter this all the time, when we have an argument on an architectural decision about Ferus,
try to keep it civil. Becoming tribal gorillas and throwing mud at each other, screaming, shouting and pointing fingers
might sound fun, but it is the worst way to go about such a problem. If your PR gets rejected, you might want to ask why (as if the reason is not provided).

However, one disagreement is absolutely not allowed, that is, "why not write this in <xyz> language?".
Ferus is a Nim program, and it will forever be one.

# Application
The CoC does not discriminate. If I decide to violate these, then the punishments will apply to me too.
No, I do not care if you are the top contributor. A violation is a violation.

There is a "strike" system depending on how many violations you have:
| Violation Count | Punishment                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1               | Nothing. A warning and that is it.                                             |
| 2               | 1 day ban from engaging in the project (commits, issues, discussions)          |
| 3               | 1 week ban from engaging in the project (commits, issues, discussions)         |
| 4               | 8 month ban from engaging in the project (commits, issues, discussions)        |
| 5               | Permanent ban from ever engaging in the project (commits, issues, discussions) |
