# The Ferus DOM API

This is an implementation of the WHATWG DOM specification. It is in no way complete yet as I am still reading the entire document (no pun intended).

Files/folders and explanation:

# dom.nim

Contains the stylesheet and HTML Document object.

# document.nim

Contains the HTML document itself. Somewhat standards compliant.

# events/event.nim

DOM events as per the WHATWG standard. Still incomplete.
